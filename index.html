      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <small>(Click the query to view an answer)</small>
      <section>
        <details>
          <summary>How old does my kid need to be to join?</summary>
          <p>We accept 8 years old and up into our dojo.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            I would like my kid to join, but have no idea what class(es) they
            should do
          </summary>
          <p>
            Historically, most kids would start with Beginner's HTML, which is
            an introduction to web development, teaching how to make websites,
            just like this one!
          </p>
          <p>
            However, moving to a beginner-friendly programming class like
            Beginner's Python, which will teach real programming and
            scripting, would also be a great choice.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            If my kid doesn't like the class they joined can they switch?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes! This isn't like school - if the kid doesn't like what they're
            doing, they're not going to learn much so there's no point in
            making them stick it out. You can change class whenever you want,
            and encourage new kids to move around for their first two weeks if
            they're not sure what class to join.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What facilities are available?</summary>
          <p>
            There's a kitchen, where parents can wait, with a coffee machine
            (that also does hot chocolate), a kettle, teabags, and mugs and
            glasses. This is a place recommended for parents to stay, as there
            is seating and is a good atmosphere to chat with other parents.
          </p>

          <p>
            Free guest WiFi (get in touch with one of the mentors, or the Dojo
            leader (Thomas) to get access.)
          </p>

          <p>There is a wheelchair-accessible bathroom.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            I would like to keep an eye on my kid while they're in class, is
            this ok?
          </summary>

          <p>
            Yes! Parents can sit-in on classes and help their kid if they
            like.
